        <h1>A picture is worth a thousand words</h1>
        <p>On the site <a href="http://www.naacp.org/criminal-justice-fact-sheet/">naacp.org</a> it says "Nationwide, African American children represent 32% of children who are arrested, 42% of children who are detained, and 52% of children whose cases are judicially waived to criminal court. Though African Americans and Hispanics make up approximately 32% of the US population, they comprised 56% of all incarcerated people in 2015.If African Americans and Hispanics were incarcerated at the same rates as whites, prison and jail populations would decline by almost 40%.
        African Americans and whites use drugs at similar rates, but the imprisonment rate of African Americans for drug charges is almost 6 times that of whites.African Americans represent 12.5% of illicit drug users, but 29% of those arrested for drug offenses and 33% of those incarcerated in state facilities for drug offenses."</p>
